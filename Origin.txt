techKNOWLEDGEe was created by Dave M on the 25th of November, 1998 in Oregon, USA.
His brand soon caught the eyes of Kasper Industry Co. They were fascinated by this "online supermarket".
This was something special. So Kasper Industry Co. bought out the techKNOWLEDGEe brand on the 6th of December,
1999 for $200,000 and were nice enough to let Dave keep his position as CEO though he had to move to Redmond, Washington to where the new headquarters were.
