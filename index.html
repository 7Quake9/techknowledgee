<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS">When you're buying at techKNOWLEDGEe. For every $1000AUD you spend on each purchase we will be giving away 10 AM radios and<br> 30 AA batteries to people living in remote areas and/or people in need. But why specifically these outdated radios that don't even sound good?<br> Because AM radios can detect signals from very far away. Especially at night where you could get a transmission from Aukland all the way in Adelade.
 <br>Meaning people living in rural communities can still have access to news, music, important emergancy broadcasts and more without having to move to a more populated area.</p>
